# Homework 11

## Project Work Balance:
I completed Assignment 1 on my own. I completed Assignment 2 with the help of Mona (nm2773). 
She helped me significantly with the coding for the clustering analysis and for the data wrangling. Kristi (kk3374) 
helped me download the data.

### Assignment 1:
For this assignment I plotted CUSP (1 Metrotech Center) on a map along with every 10th census tract. I also used the 
geometry.intersects function to discover which tract CUSP was specifically located within.

### Assignment 2:
For this assignment, I first wrangled and cleaned the necessary datasets. Then, I plotted a timeseries analysis of 
the standardized number of businesses established by zip code to explore the data. I then performed both K-Means and Hierarchical clustering analyses on the data. Lastly, I plotted both clustering types as maps using the merged datasets.
