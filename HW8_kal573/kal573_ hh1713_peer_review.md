### Peer Review:

This boxplot depicts the ride length of male and female CitiBike users. The colors used are clear and easy to read. 
The information is correctly displayed in the plot.

However, the plot could be improved by changing the color for each rider (male/female) rather than labeling on the x axis. 
Also, the title and axis labels could be have a larger font size.
Lastly, the plot image in the python notebook is too large to view on my computer screen at one time, and I have to scroll to view the entire plot. 
Therefore, I would reccomend making the figure size smaller for users to view entirely at once.
