### Peer Review:

The plot above describes the change in average catch depth for fish, taken from Rutgers University. 
It depicts information for both the spring and fall seasons.  
The plot is easy to read, with contrasting colors and a clear legend.  
The information is communicated effectively.

However, the plot could be improved if a title was included.  
Similarly, I think it would be helpful to denote on the y axis where the zero point is (no change) to highlight years when the 
average catch depth is increasing or decreasing.
