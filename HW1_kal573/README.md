# PUI2016 Homework 1


## Project Work Balance:

**Assignment 1:** I completed this assignment on my own, and performed the fork with Claire (xh895)

**Assignment 2:** Mona (nm2773) has a background in computer science so she helped explain Github, Terminal, and basic coding principles during this assignment. She also helped me create this README fie properly.

To set up my work environment, I followed the commands from the assignment file:

`ssh -X -A -t kal573@gw.cusp.nyu.edu`

`ssh -A -X compute`

Once I accessed compute, I created the new directory PUI2016_kal573:

`mkdir PUI2016_kal573`

I then created a new environmental variable, `PUI2016_kal573` in `.bash_profile` using nano and source commands as shown in the screenshot.

I also created the alias `pui2016` in `.bash_profile` as shown in the screenshot.
