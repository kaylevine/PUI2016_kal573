# Homework 9

## Project Work Balance:

I completed this homework assignment with Mona (nm2773) and Claire (xh895). Mona helped with plotting the fft correctly, 
Claire helped us figure out how to use rolling means, and I helped with fourier transforms.

## Assignment 1:

This homework assignment used MTA subway turnstile data to perform a timeseries analysis. To complete Task 1, we discovered 
that Hurricane Sandy occurred on October 21st, 2012 using a standard deviation threshold. To complete Task 2, we identified 
trend directions (positive/negative) using the first and last data entries in the time series. To complete Task 3, we used 
fourier transforms to determine which four stations show an annual trend.
