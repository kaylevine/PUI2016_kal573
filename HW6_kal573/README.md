# Homework 6

## Project Work Balance:

I completed both assignments with Claire and Mona. For Assignment 1, Claire and I worked on the beginning portion of the assignment, and Mona helped us with the log plots and statistical anlaysis. For Assignment 2, we all worked together to perform the Z test. In the Authorea report, I wrote the majority of the text, Mona helped create the appropriate figures, and Claire helped with the statistics and latex formatting.
