# Homework 7
### Work Balance: I completed this assignment on my own.

### Plot:
My notebook contains a plot about temperature data in New York State. Specifically, the number of heat wave days per year
were plotted as a bar graph, and the average daily temperature for each year is a scatter plot towards the top of the figure.

Each axis is color-coded to its corresponding data.
