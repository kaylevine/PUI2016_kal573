Hi Kaylyn!
The plot is really pretty! If something could be improved a little bit, suggested as below:</br>
1.if the data starts from 1990, the plot would be better to start from 1990 as well, instead of 1985.the end year is the same.</br>
2.is it better to overlap average number of heat wave days and average daily temperature, to see their relationship?
