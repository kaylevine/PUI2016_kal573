# PUI2016 Homework 5

## Project Work Balance:
I worked with Mona and Claire while completing all three assignments. Mona helped with the coding, I helped with formulating the hypotheses, and Claire helped explain the statistical analyses.

## Assignment 1:

## Assignment 2:

## Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis

### Experiment 1: Do ddiets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Null Hypothesis: The average weight loss of people who dieted (P_1) is the same as the average weight loss of people who only exercised (P_2).

Alternative Hypothesis: The average weight loss of people who dieted (P_1) is the different than the average weight loss of people who only exercised (P_2).

H_0: P_1 = P_2

H_a: P_1 != P_2

### Experiment 2: Do Americans trust the president?

Null Hypothesis: The percentage of Americans who trust the president (P_1) is same or less than 45% at significance level p=0.05.

Alternative Hypothesis: The percentage of Americans who trust the president is greater than than 45% at significance level p=0.05.

H_0: P_1 <= .45

H_a: P_1 > .45

### Experiment 3: Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.

Null Hypothesis: The percentage of smokers assigned to use nicotine patches (P_1) who quit is the same or less than the placebo group (P_0).

Alternative Hypothesis: The percentage of smokers assigned to use nicotine patches (P_1) who quit is the greater than the placebo group (P_0).

H_0: P_1 <= P_0

H_a: P_1 > P_0

### Experiment 4: Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.

Null Hypothesis: The average IQ of children age 1-4 whose mother smoked (P_1) is the same or greater than the average IQ of children age 1-4 whose mother did not smoke (P_0).

Alternative Hypothesis: The average IQ of children age 1-4 whose mother smoked (P_1) is the less than the average IQ of children age 1-4 whose mother did not smoke (P_0).

H_0: P_1 >= P_0

H_a: P_1 < P_0
